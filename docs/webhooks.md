# Webhooks

## Overview

The webhook system delivers lifecycle events (e.g. `vault_created`, `vault_completed`, `vault_failed`, `vault_cancelled`) to registered subscriber URLs via HTTP POST with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification.

## Subscriber Management

Subscribers are stored in-memory (same pattern as API keys). Each subscriber has:

- `id` – UUID
- `url` – target endpoint
- `secret` – HMAC signing key
- `events` – event types to subscribe to (empty = wildcard)
- `active` – delivery flag

### SSRF Protection

`isUrlAllowed()` blocks loopback, link-local, and RFC-1918 addresses. If `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set, the target hostname must also match.

## Delivery

`dispatchWebhookEvent()` sends a payload to all eligible active subscribers. Each delivery is retried with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts).

### Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `x-disciplr-signature` | `sha256=<hex-digest>` HMAC-SHA256 of the JSON body |
| `x-disciplr-event` | Event type (e.g. `vault_created`) |
| `x-disciplr-event-id` | Originating event ID in `{txHash}:{eventIndex}` format |
| `x-disciplr-delivery-timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp |

## Dead-Letter Queue

When a delivery permanently fails (exhausts retries), the failed delivery is persisted to the `webhook_dead_letters` table for later inspection and replay.

### Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `subscriber_id` | UUID | Subscriber that failed to receive |
| `event_id` | TEXT | Event ID (`{txHash}:{eventIndex}`) |
| `event_type` | VARCHAR(128) | Event type |
| `payload` | JSONB | Original delivery payload |
| `last_error` | TEXT | Last error message |
| `attempts` | INTEGER | Number of delivery attempts |
| `failed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the delivery permanently failed |
| `replayed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the entry was replayed (null if not yet) |

### Admin API

#### GET `/api/admin/webhooks/dead-letters`

List dead-letter entries with optional `subscriber_id` filter.

Query params: `limit`, `offset`, `subscriber_id`

Response:
```json
{
  "webhook_dead_letters": [...],
  "count": 10,
  "total": 42,
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0,
  "has_more": true
}
```

#### POST `/api/admin/webhooks/dead-letters/:id/replay`

Replays a dead-letter entry. Validates the URL is still allowed, then re-delivers to the subscriber's in-memory handler. Stamps `replayed_at` on success.

Response (202):
```json
{ "replayed": true }
```

Response (404):
```json
{ "error": "Dead letter not found or already replayed" }
```

## Testing

Run webhook tests:
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=webhooks
```

DLQ tests require a PostgreSQL database (`DATABASE_URL`). Without it, they are skipped gracefully.
